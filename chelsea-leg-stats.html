				<p><strong>Peter Osgood</strong> is a former Chelsea striker who was prolific during the 60's                   and 70's. During his time at Chelsea, Osgood - also affectionately known as King Ossie -                     made 380 appearances, and scored 150 goals. Osgood earned the nickname, "King of Stamford                     Bridge", due to exceptional skill as a footballer and also for his personality and status.                    In addition to playing for Chelsea, Osgood was capped four times to play for England in                     the 1970's. Ossie, a true Chelsea legend, passed away on March 1, 2006 after suffering 					 from a heart attack. And in a memorial service on October 1, 2006, his ashes were buried at                   Stamford Bridge under the penalty spot of the Shed End.

                <h4>Name: Gianfranco Zola</h4>
                <h4>Position: Forward (#25)</h4>
                <h4>Years Played: 1996-2003</h4>
                <p><strong>Gianfranco Zola </strong>is an Italian former footballer who played predominantly                    as a forward for Chelsea. During his playing career, Zola was primarily used as a                            supporting striker or as a playmaking, attacking midfielder. Zola, also known as the                          "Little Magician" and "Magic Box", was renowned for his ball control, dribbling ability,                      vision, passing, and goal scoring abilities. His small stature allowed him to be 				           very quick and agile, enabled him to change directions very quickly with the ball in tight                    spaces, and also enabled him to beat defenders in 1-v-1 situations. While Zola was with                      Chelsea, he made 229 appearances and scored 59 goals.</p>
