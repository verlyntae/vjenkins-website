		<h2>BIO</h2>
		<p>I received a bachelor's degree in Theater Production with a minor in Film &amp; Video production from Georgia State University. Before graduating from college, I'd been active in the local theater and music community as an actor and musician. I had also performed in several student films; written several screenplays; and directed a silent student film.
			<br>
			<br>
I began my professional graphics career in 2004 as a Mac Prepress Operator at a small print shop. I gained entry-level print production experience that included using applications - such as Quark Express, Illustrator, Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Extensis Suitcase - to design, layout, fix, and print business cards, flyers, postcards, brochures, menus, and booklets.
			<br>
			<br>
I continued to develop printing skills and also gained experience with more sophisticated software and workflows. For example, I gained and developed professional experience with the burgeoning application, InDesign; I gained variable data workflow experience with both InDesign and Excel; I gained database experince with Filemaker Pro; I gained imposition experience with Preps and Prinect Signa; and 6-color printing workflow experience with Creo/Kodak Cockpit and Heidelberg Prinect Cockpit. These hard-earned skills were crucial in the printing industry; however, with the increasing rise in the mobile and web markets, plus the impending market crash of 2008, it became necessary to re-evaluate my career path and acquire new skills.
			<br>
			<br>
The Recession of 2008 forced me to develop a fresher, more in-demand set of skills. I began to learn object-oriented computer programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java; I learned web design and development; I learned Git, SVN, and Bitbucket version control; and I learned to program mobile devices and design mobile user interfaces. I also began to learn operating systems such as Linux, and scripting languages such as Unix.
